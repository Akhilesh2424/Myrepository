 Green is universally associated with nature, linked as it is to grass, plants and trees. It also represents growth and renewal, being the color of spring and rebirth. Another association is “getting the green light” to go ahead, giving it an association with taking action.

<h2>
WHY PLANTS ARE IMPORTANT ?
</h2>
<p>
Plants keep the soil together preventing erosion. Plants provide oxygen for us and all the other animals. Through photosynthesis they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen which gives us the air that allows all animals on the planet to breathe. Plants are an essential part of the water cycle.
